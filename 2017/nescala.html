              <p>Since 2011, the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ny-scala/">New York</a>, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/boston-scala/">Boston</a> and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/scala-phase/">Philadelphia</a> Scala meetups have come together every year to host a community driven, Scala conference. The conference rotates between each city, and this year it's in New York City.</p>
              <p>Many of our past speakers have been contributors to <a href="http://typelevel.org/">Typelevel</a> projects. In fact some Typelevel projects began at past Northeast Scala Symposiums! Last year Typelevel colocated their Typelevel Summit along with our conference in Philadelphia, and we're happy to say that it will happen again this year! And to make things simpler, you will only have to purchase one ticket for entrance to both events.</p>

                  All you wanted was an FP solution to dependency injection and error handling, right?

                  Let's see how far we can get with monad transformers before leaping to the next thing. You may need nothing more.</p>

Can we use Scala to create a statically typed human interaction? What are Scala limits of supporting any kind of domain? Talk with no type theory concepts, but with a twist</p>

                      <p>This talk will show how to apply hope, faith, and proof to write the best code you can. It will compare and contrast the three, then pick a winner. Along the way, this talk will look at types and tests from a new angle and highlight a new kind of assertion that deserves a place in your toolbox.</p>

                      <p>Scala is an elegant and expressive language--so why are its compilation errors so imperious and opaque? I'll talk about my experience transitioning to Scala development from PHP and make a case for a compiler that helps programmers discover the language (with the help of lots of Lucille Bluth gifs).</p>

                      <p>APIs are great! But what if your APIs were coming with a type system? What if your APIs were so predictable that versioning them was history? What if consumers of your APIs could get exactly what they want at every request? Let's discover GraphQL and its implementation in Scala: Sangria.</p>

                  Unfortunately it will not be catered, so eat your breakfast beforehand. We will provide a list of places to get lunch by Saturday.
                  We have 6 rooms: 1 auditorium, 2 classrooms, and three conference rooms. The auditorium and classrooms have a wide variety of display adapters, and the three conference rooms require a VGA adapter.<br><br>
                  <span style="font-weight:bold">How it works:</span> show up and take a look at our Google Sheet which will have rooms along the top row and times along the first column. If you have a talk you want to give, or a topic you'd like to discuss, pick a slot on the sheet, write a short blurb and then show up to that room at that time. This is meant to be very informal, and people are allowed to float around in and out of rooms while they are in session. Take a look at <a href="http://bit.ly/2mYgckF">last year's sheet</a> to get a more conrete idea

              <p><i>Just a heads up on the location: the Google Street View makes the place look like a dump. The image is from several years ago and has since been renovated and it's much nicer now. Bing has a much better <a href="https://binged.it/2j3DYxe">view</a> (thanks @derekmorr)</i></p>
              <p>The conference will be in the Dumbo neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY at <a href="http://www.26bridge.com/">26 Bridge</a>, whose address is unsurprisingly: <br><br><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/26+Bridge+St,+Brooklyn,+NY+11201/@40.7039628,-73.9871895,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c25a32e4bc73a7:0xc9dc9bc26ed594d6!8m2!3d40.7039628!4d-73.9850008">26 Bridge St.<br>Brooklyn, NY 11201</a></p>
              <p>It's just a short, five minute walk from the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/York+Street/@40.7030518,-73.9879941,17z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x89c25a32e4bc73a7:0xc9dc9bc26ed594d6!2s26+Bridge+St,+Brooklyn,+NY+11201!3b1!8m2!3d40.7039628!4d-73.9850008!3m4!1s0x89c25a3389143497:0x673b92bb04377cd9!8m2!3d40.7013507!4d-73.9866026">York St. F-train stop</a>, which is one stop outside of Manhattan. If you are unfamiliar with Dumbo, it's right across the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan's Financial District. It's very safe and very trendy. You ought to check out the neighborhood while you're there.</p>

              <p>There is a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/New+York+Marriott+at+The+Brooklyn+Bridge/@40.6974761,-73.9896916,15.67z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1smarriott!3m4!1s0x0:0x175dbb4c26c2225f!8m2!3d40.693669!4d-73.9880034">Marriott</a> not far from the venue. Aside from that there aren't any other hotels in the neighborhood, but it's only a five minute walk from the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/York+Street/@40.6974761,-73.9896916,15.67z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1smarriott!3m4!1s0x89c25a3389143497:0x673b92bb04377cd9!8m2!3d40.7013497!4d-73.9866033">York St. F-train subway stop</a>, so our advice is to find a hotel not far from an F-Train stop so you can take it to the venue. The <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/High+Street/@40.6985476,-73.9860459,16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c25a36f57f83e7:0xe6e14ba9ee8d83a6!8m2!3d40.6994301!4d-73.9914098">High St. A and C train stop</a> isn't far from the venue either, so staying near one of those trains, or somewhere in the Financial District in lower Manhattan would be a good option. That said, the walk to the venue from the High St. stop is a bit confusing. If you choose this option, make sure your phone is fully charged so you can use Google Maps to find the venue. And honestly Google Maps won't steer you wrong, so if you're comfortable riding the subway, you can stay just about anywhere. Taxis and Uber are obviously an option to get to and from the venue too.</p>
              <p>If you're looking to save a little bit of money, you may be able to find a better deal on Airbnb in Dumbo or a nearby neighborhood. Dumbo and the neighborhoods around Dumbo are safe. Randy and Dustin both live not far from Dumbo, so if you've found an Airbnb you want a sanity check on, please feel free to contact us and we'll be happy to take a look for you.</p>
